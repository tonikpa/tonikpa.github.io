                Angra is a procedural terrain generator developed in the Unity game engine. 
                It is a tool to create infinite and random landscapes. 
                The bulk of the program is based on compute shaders, written in HLSL, that are executed on the GPU. 
                Angra started as my final project for university, where I extensively compared different algorithms (and different implementations of the same algorithm) in metrics such as execution time, memory cost and aesthetical results.

                The project’s biggest challenge was creating interesting and diverse visual results while ensuring a smooth performance. 
                The final version of the project uses an optimized implementation of the marching cubes algorithm to generate the terrain’s polygonal mesh data. 
                This data is generated by computer shaders in the GPU and is very sizeable. 
                To avoid data transfers from the GPU to the CPU (a very slow process), Unity’s DrawProceduralIndirect function is used in conjunction with a custom vertex/fragment shader to draw the terrain directly in the GPU with the compute shader data. 
                This guarantees great performance, virtually ending terrain pop in, and enabling the creation of terraforming tools.

                Some of the features implemented include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Creation of meshes with varying levels of detail, lowering the computational cost of rendering distant terrain.</li>
                    <li>Implementation of different biomes, such as deserts, islands, and mountainous terrains, allowing the generation of more varied landscapes.</li>
                    <li>A terraforming tool, allowing users to modify the terrain in real time.</li>
