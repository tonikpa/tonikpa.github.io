            Hello! My name is Antonio and I am a Rio de Janeiro based game developer and software engineer. 
            I have recently graduated from one of Brazil's top universities, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering with cum laude honors. 
            I have worked in the past as a full stack web developer, maintaining and improving platforms with over 300k monthly active users.
        </p>
        <p>  
            I am deeply passionate about video games and the gaming industry. 
            In my free time I’m a hobbyist game developer, and I’m actively looking for a job opportunity in the area. 
            In this portfolio website I present a sample of the work I’ve done in the recent years. 
            These projects involve topics that I’m deeply interested in, such as graphics programming and procedural content generation. 
            For further information, please <a href="media/cv.pdf">refer to my resume</a> and feel free to contact me.
        </p>
